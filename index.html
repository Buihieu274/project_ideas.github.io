<pre>     a. Overview:
            My project is to develop a mobile game called Finding Treasure using tools such as Unity 
            which is easy to play, eye-catching, addictive and difficult get bored elements. My goal is 
            convenience and everyone can play my game as long as they have a smartphone. I will give 
            some typical and successful examples such as Flappy Bird, Among Us, Adorable Home, Mario, 
            …  All of them are easy to play, if I am the creator of those games, I will make them with better 
            graphics in the future. 

          b. Motivation:
            My idea stems from my flight waiting times. I usually have to wait 30 minutes from 1 hour
            before boarding time, so I always play some fast and offline games after watching facebook or 
            instagram to kill the time. Moreover, users who play those games will be hard to remove those 
            games because of  interesting, convenience and not boring in their many free times. Another 
            important part is that those games can have a lot of ads that users are not only uncomfortable but 
            also like because it can give them hints and the publisher of those games will get money from ads.
    
          c. Description:
            Like the name of the game, player will find a treasure hidden on an island, each level will be a 
            different islands with different challenges. When first heard of it, it seems to be like other similar 
            games but the difference is that in every treasure found, it will have an item related to the next 
            level. For example, the saw is used to cut trees or the match box to make a fire. In order not to 
            make users bored, I can create a lot of spaces like cities in the world, planets in the solar system. 
            That is the way to play Finding Treasure.

                                <img src="https://cdn.tgdd.vn/2020/08/content/top-10-mang-xa-hoi-pho-bien-nhat-trung-quoc-8-800x450.jpg" width=750 height=300/>

            In addition to the gaming features, this project can link to other popular social networks like 
            Facebook, Instagram or Google so that players can play with friends by linking accounts together 
            and finding treasure in the same island and share it on their own social networks. When a game 
            has connection with many people, it will be spread more and players will be more enjoy the 
            game. That is also an effective way of advertising the game.

            Because this game is offline and free to download, business will come from two mai sources: 
            advertisement and the purchase of in-game resources. For in-game resources, the players can buy 
            hints or objects to support the game play. As for the advertisements, they will appear every time 
            the player finish a level or buys hints by watching ads.

          d. Tool and technologies:
            First of all, i need to know Unity software which is a cross-platform game making software 
            developed by Unity technology. Secondly, I need to know the programing languages to code 
            such as C, C++, Python, … In addition, I also use Visual Studio Code for coding development. 
            Finally for the graphics and effects, I will use Flash software.

          e. Skills required:
            It makes sure that I need to understand the skills to use the software above.

          f. Outcomes:
            If the project succeeds, I will produce an interesting, eye-catching and addictive game for 
            players. The game will bring to users a comfortable and funny game that players will always 
            keep it in their phone and not uninstall. That is also my purpose.
